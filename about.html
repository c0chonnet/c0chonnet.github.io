	<p class="vaenaton">I am Kira, a self-taught artist born in 1995. As a child, I was obsessed with ancient Egypt, hence the nickname "vaenaton," 
	meaning "the only one for Aton." 	
	At the age of 15, 
	I started painting on my computer, but after the first plein air sessions in Pskov, my hometown, I switched to traditional art.</p>
		
	<p>I have never been a full-time artist. My career began in 2016 from a marketing role, and within a couple of years, 
	I used this experience to transition to data field. Although a creative path is sometimes seen as a contradiction to a career 
	in a company and vice versa, I enjoy working with data while maintaining the art practice. Constantly trying to find common ground in 
	everything I find interesting, in 2021, 
	I received a master's degree in Digital Humanities. During my master's, I taught Digital literacy at the university, where I guided students' data projects and created a lesson on building simple websites for an online course. By making this page, I attempt to somehow combine all my experiences.</p>
	
	<p>I typically work with acrylics, gouache, and oil pastels, drawing inspiration mainly from everyday 
	life observations, emotional experiences, and memories. Since I began drawing nude figures with ink at life drawing model sessions in 2022, I've increasingly used ink in my work and developed an interest in graphic art. Tools I use at work include Python, SQL, Javascript and more;  I'm always curious to apply these skills in DH and art projects.</p>
